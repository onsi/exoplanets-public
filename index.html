It's been a great run. From its origins as
      a list of "real" planets made by Paul Butler, to the <em>Catalog
      of Nearby Exoplanets</em> as <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...646..505B">a chapter of my thesis</a>, to the two
      iterations of <tt>exoplanets.org</tt> with its incomparable
      Exoplanets Data Explorers written by the amazing Onsi Fakhouri,
      I've been able to watch the field explode from dozens of RV planets
      to a hundred times that, and the <em>TESS</em> planet wave has
      only just begun. It's been a privilege to work with so many
      people to try to keep up with the field, but it's no longer
      practical for my little team to do so, especially with so many other efforts and
      exoplanet lists out there.<P>
      I'm happy to report that, working with Peter Forshay over the past few months, we've
      mananged to get the database more-or-less complete up through
      June 2018, and it's now one of the sources of data for
      <tt>exo.mast</tt>.
      I may continue to make small corrections to the
      database going forward as a record of where things were in 2018,
      and I have reason to believe that some new planets will continue
      to be added to the database from other routes,
      but June 2018 marks the sunset of regular updates by me and my team.
      <P>But <b>this site will continue to exist and improve;</b> in fact we
      hope that the next several months will see some nice integration
      of the site with services at STScI, including potentially a much better use
      of the RV plot windows on the detail pages than the ubiquitous "velocity profile currently unavailable."
      <P>And fans of Onsi's Data Explorers will be happy to learn that
      there are plans
      afoot to adapt it for new databases and new uses, including
      potentially other lists of planets that will stay up-to-date. I can't say
      more now but don't be surprised if in a couple of years those great color plots start
      appearing in talks about not just exoplanets but other kinds of
      astronomical objects as well!
      <P>
      Thanks so much to the many many people who worked over the past
      10 years at Penn State to enter and
      manage data on <tt>exoplanets.org</tt>, including Sharon Wang, Ming Zhao,
      Jacob Brown, Mcleod Brennaman, Eunkyu Han, Kat Feng, and Colin
      Hancock. 
      <P>
      Finally, thanks to everyone who uses <tt>exoplanets.org</tt> for
      talks and for research, and who 
      have encouraged me to try to keep it going for as long as I
      can. It's been gratifying to see how the hard work that goes into
      the site has supported so much research for so long.

        The Exoplanet Data Explorer is an interactive table and
        plotter for exploring and displaying data from the Exoplanet
        Orbit Database. The Exoplanet Orbit Database is a carefully
        constructed compilation of quality, spectroscopic orbital
        parameters of exoplanets orbiting normal stars from the
        peer-reviewed literature, and updates the Catalog of nearby
        exoplanets.
      </p>
      <p>
        A detailed description of the Exoplanet Orbit Database and Explorers is
        published <a
        href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASP..126..827H">here</a>
        and is available on <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/1012.5676">astro-ph</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the Exoplanet Data Explorer, we have also provided the entire Exoplanet Orbit Database in CSV format for a quick and convenient download <a href="/csv-files/exoplanets.csv">here</a>.  A list of all archived CSVs is available <a href="/csv">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Help and documentation for the Exoplanet Data Explorer is
        available <a href="/help/common/data">here</a>.  A FAQ and
        overview of our methodology is <a
        href="./methodology.html">here</a>, including answers to
        the questions "Why isn't my favorite planet/datum in the EOD?"
        and "Why does site X list more planets than this one?".
